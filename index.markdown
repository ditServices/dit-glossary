## Pinned Definitions

### [Near Set DIT]( {% link docs/2023-12-12-near-set.md %} )

The role of a near-set DIT is characterized as a hybrid position, encompassing both data management and certain aspects of traditional DIT responsibilities. While this role involves undertaking tasks related to data management and DIT functions, it is advisable for the technician not to directly handle live camera feeds or manage exposure settings.

Instead, the near-set DIT typically focuses on tasks such as overseeing data transfer, ensuring the integrity and organization of digital assets, and collaborating with the camera team members. By concentrating on data management aspects, the near-set DIT contributes to the overall efficiency of the production process without directly engaging in tasks that might be more appropriately handled by the on-set DIT, such as adjusting exposure or handling live camera feeds. This division of responsibilities allows for a streamlined workflow, with each role playing to its strengths and ensuring optimal performance in both data management and DIT tasks.

### [On Set DIT]( {% link docs/2023-12-12-on-set.md %} )

A DIT on set, often known as a "Livegrade DIT" owing to the specific software utilized, is widely recommended, particularly for high-end productions where meticulous color management is crucial. In this specialized role, the technician actively engages with a live feed from the camera, employing a series of precise color transforms within an approved color management system tailored to the project's requirements.

Within the context of on-set operations, the division of responsibilities becomes crucial for optimizing workflow. Typically, data management tasks are entrusted to an assistant or a dedicated data manager, often supported by a dailies lab. This strategic allocation of responsibilities ensures that the DIT can focus on real-time color adjustments and image enhancement without being encumbered by data management duties.

Conversely, the practice of managing data on a mobile cart that traverses the set and various locations is discouraged. This approach is considered suboptimal, as it may not only compromise the integrity of the data but also limit the technician's capabilities, particularly in terms of comprehensive image analysis. By centralizing data management responsibilities and adhering to a more controlled environment, the Livegrade DIT can concentrate on refining and perfecting the visual aspects of the production, ultimately contributing to the overall quality of the final product.
