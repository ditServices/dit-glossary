A Display Rendering Transform (DRT) refers to a process or set of operations applied to digital imagery or graphical content to adapt it for optimal presentation on a display device. This transformation is typically employed to address factors such as color accuracy, contrast, brightness, and spatial characteristics, ensuring that the visual representation aligns with the characteristics of the target display.
