# OCN

Original Camera Negative (OCN) refers to the unprocessed and original video clips that directly captures the images during the filming or recording of a production. The OCN is essentially the first-generation version that preserves the original content as captured by the camera's lens.

The OCN retains the highest quality and detail of the recorded images, making it a valuable and irreplaceable asset in the post-production process. Colorists work with the OCN to create the final graded version of the film, manipulating colors, contrast, and other visual elements. Preserving the OCN is crucial for maintaining the highest possible image quality throughout the filmmaking workflow and for future preservation or remastering efforts.
