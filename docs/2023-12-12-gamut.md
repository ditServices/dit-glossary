# Gamut

Gamut refers to the entire range of colors that a color space or device can represent. It is often visualized as a three-dimensional volume within a color space model, encapsulating all possible color combinations that can be produced or displayed. The term is crucial in fields such as imaging, printing, and display technologies, as it defines the limits of color reproduction. A larger gamut signifies a broader range of achievable colors, while a smaller gamut may result in limitations, potentially leading to color inaccuracies or the inability to reproduce certain shades accurately. Understanding gamut is essential for maintaining color fidelity and consistency in various visual applications.
