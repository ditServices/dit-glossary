# Bokeh 

Bokeh refers to the aesthetic quality of the out-of-focus areas in a photograph, characterized by a soft and blurred background that enhances the visual separation between the subject and its surroundings. Achieved through the manipulation of depth of field, Bokeh contributes to a visually pleasing and often dreamy or artistic effect in photography, with the appearance of smooth, circular highlights created by defocused points of light.
