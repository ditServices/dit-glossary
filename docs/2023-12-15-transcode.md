# Transcode

The process of transcoding [Original Camera Negative (OCN)]({% link docs/2023-12-15-ocn.md %}) camera material involves converting the raw and high-resolution footage captured during filming into lower-resolution proxy or offline clips. This transformation is typically performed during the post-production workflow. Transcoding to offline or proxy clips allows for a more streamlined editing process. High-resolution [OCN]({% link docs/2023-12-15-ocn.md %}) files are often large and can be computationally demanding, making them less practical for real-time editing. By creating lower-resolution versions, editors can work more efficiently with smoother playback and quicker response times.
