# White Balance

White balance is a camera setting that adjusts the colour balance in an image to ensure that white objects appear truly white, regardless of the lighting conditions. It is a crucial aspect of photography and videography, as different light sources (such as sunlight, fluorescent lights, or incandescent bulbs) have varying colour temperatures. White balance settings help neutralize colour casts, preventing images from appearing too warm (orange) or too cool (blue). Common white balance presets include daylight, tungsten, fluorescent, and cloudy, and custom white balance allows photographers to manually calibrate the camera for specific lighting environments. Proper white balance ensures accurate colour reproduction in photographic and video content.
