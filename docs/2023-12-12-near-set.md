# Near Set DIT

The role of a near-set DIT is characterized as a hybrid position, encompassing both data management and certain aspects of traditional DIT responsibilities. While this role involves undertaking tasks related to data management and DIT functions, it is advisable for the technician not to directly handle live camera feeds or manage exposure settings.

Instead, the near-set DIT typically focuses on tasks such as overseeing data transfer, ensuring the integrity and organization of digital assets, and collaborating with the camera team members. By concentrating on data management aspects, the near-set DIT contributes to the overall efficiency of the production process without directly engaging in tasks that might be more appropriately handled by the on-set DIT, such as adjusting exposure or handling live camera feeds. This division of responsibilities allows for a streamlined workflow, with each role playing to its strengths and ensuring optimal performance in both data management and DIT tasks.
