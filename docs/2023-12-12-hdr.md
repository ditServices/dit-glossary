# HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) video is an imaging technology that expands the contrast and color range of video content beyond what is achievable with standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR video captures and displays a wider range of luminance levels, allowing for more details in both bright highlights and dark shadows. This technology enhances the overall visual experience by providing a more lifelike and immersive representation of scenes. HDR is commonly associated with increased bit depth, wider color gamuts, and advanced display technologies, offering viewers a more realistic and visually stunning portrayal of video content, particularly in terms of brightness, color accuracy, and detail.
