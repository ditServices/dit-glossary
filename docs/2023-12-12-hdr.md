# HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) video is an display technology that expands the contrast and colour range of video content beyond what is achievable with standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR displays a wider range of luminance levels, allowing for more details in both bright highlights and dark shadows. This technology enhances the overall visual experience by providing a more lifelike and immersive representation of scenes. HDR is commonly associated with increased bit depth, wider colour gamuts, and advanced display technologies, offering viewers a more realistic and visually stunning portrayal of video content, particularly in terms of brightness, colour accuracy, and detail.
