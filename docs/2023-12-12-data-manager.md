# Data Manager

A data manager is tasked with offloading and backing up camera cards for the on-set DIT. The data manager is a skilled role, that is a step up from a DIT Assistant. Though the role may still incorporate some duties that would be expected of an assistant, such as admin tasks and managing RF transmitters.
