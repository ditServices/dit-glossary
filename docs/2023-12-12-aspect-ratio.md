# Aspect ratio

Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image, screen, or display. It is commonly expressed as a ratio (e.g., 4:3, 16:9), representing the width relative to the height. Different aspect ratios serve various purposes in photography, filmmaking, and display technologies, influencing the visual composition and framing of images. For example, widescreen aspect ratios are prevalent in modern cinema, while traditional television often uses a more square-shaped aspect ratio.
