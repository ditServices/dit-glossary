# LCD

Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is a type of flat-panel display technology widely used in monitors, televisions, and other visual display devices. LCDs operate by manipulating the alignment of liquid crystals sandwiched between two layers of glass to control the passage of light. These crystals act as shutters, allowing or blocking light to create images on the screen. LCD displays are known for their thin profile, energy efficiency, and the ability to produce sharp and vibrant visuals. They come in various forms, including twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), and other advanced variants, each offering different characteristics related to color reproduction, viewing angles, and response times.
