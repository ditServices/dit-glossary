# Genlock

Genlock, short for "generator locking," is a synchronization technique used in video production and broadcasting. It involves aligning the timing signals of multiple video sources to ensure their frames are perfectly synchronized. This synchronization is vital when combining multiple video signals to prevent visual artifacts such as tearing, flickering, or misalignment. Genlock is commonly employed in settings where multiple cameras, graphics generators, or other video sources are involved, ensuring a seamless and coherent presentation. It is especially crucial in live broadcasts, virtual studios, and other scenarios where precise timing and synchronization are paramount for high-quality video production.
