# Bit Depth

Bit depth, also known as color depth, refers to the number of bits used to represent each pixel in a digital image or the amount of information that can be stored for each channel of color in an image. Common bit depths include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. Higher bit depths allow for a more extensive range of colors and greater precision in representing subtle variations in shades and tones. Increased bit depth is particularly important in professional image editing and digital imaging to avoid color banding and accurately capture the nuances of color and brightness in visual content.
