# On-Set DIT

An on-set DIT is also commonly known as a Livegrade DIT named after the software that is used. However, this is to be discouraged as there are other software packages that an on-set DIT could use to perform the same task.

In this role the technician will be on-set taking a live feed from the camera and applying a series of colour transforms within the confines of a colour management system that has been approved for the project. 

In this role, data management duties are often handed to an assistant or data manager in combination with the support of a dailies lab.
