# Digital Lab / Dailies Lab

A Digital Dailies Lab is a central facility in contemporary film production dedicated to processing and reviewing daily footage captured during shoots. Managed by experienced technicians, the lab ensures a swift and secure transfer of raw digital files from set cameras. It conducts rigorous quality control, applies preliminary colour grading, and securely stores the material for subsequent post-production stages. The lab offers filmmakers early visual feedback, expediting decision-making and fostering collaboration among key stakeholders.

Digital Dailies Labs provide a rapid turnaround for reviewing daily footage, allowing for informed creative decisions and efficient problem-solving. This centralized approach offloads technical responsibilities from on-set crews, enabling them to focus on capturing high-quality footage. By streamlining communication between on-set and post-production teams, the lab contributes to a more efficient workflow, ultimately enhancing the overall success of film production.
