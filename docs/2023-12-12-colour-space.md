# Colour Space

A colour space is a specific organization of colors, defined by a set of color components and their associated coordinates. It provides a standardized way to represent and reproduce colors in a digital or physical medium. Common color spaces, such as Arri Log-C and Sony S-Log, are used in digital cinematography, while others like sRGB and Adobe RGB are prevalent in photography. Color spaces help ensure consistency in color representation across devices and applications, facilitating accurate color communication in various fields, including digital media, printing, and photography.
