# LUT

A Look-Up Table (LUT) is a mathematical table or set of rules used in digital imaging and color grading to map one set of color values to another. In the context of color correction and grading, LUTs are often employed to transform the colors in an image, achieving specific looks or corrections. Cinematographers, photographers, and video professionals use LUTs to maintain color consistency across different devices and workflows. LUTs can be utilized for tasks ranging from basic color correction to the application of creative stylizations. They play a crucial role in ensuring color accuracy and achieving desired visual aesthetics in various digital imaging applications.
