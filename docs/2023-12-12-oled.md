# OLED

OLED, or Organic Light-Emitting Diode, is a display technology used in screens for televisions, smartphones, and other electronic devices. Unlike traditional LCDs, OLED displays consist of individual organic compounds that emit light when an electric current is applied, eliminating the need for a separate backlight. This enables OLED displays to achieve deeper blacks, higher contrast ratios, and faster response times. Additionally, OLED technology allows for flexible and thinner screen designs. OLED displays offer vibrant colors, wide viewing angles, and improved energy efficiency, making them a popular choice for high-end consumer electronics where superior image quality and design flexibility are prioritized.
