# Extraction

In the context of a camera frame, extraction refers to the process of isolating or capturing a specific portion or element from the overall visual composition. This may involve focusing on a particular subject, cropping a segment of the scene, or highlighting specific details. Extraction is a fundamental aspect of cinematography and photography, allowing creators to draw attention to key elements, emphasize storytelling elements, or create visually compelling compositions by isolating subjects within the frame.
