# SSD / HDD

SSD (Solid State Drive) and HDD (Hard Disk Drive) are storage devices used in computers and other electronic devices to store and retrieve digital data.

SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, offering faster read and write speeds, lower latency, and improved durability compared to traditional HDDs. They are commonly used in laptops, desktops, and other devices where speed and reliability are crucial. SSDs are available in various form factors, including SATA, M.2, and PCIe, and are known for providing quicker boot times and improved overall system responsiveness.

HDDs consist of rotating disks or platters coated with a magnetic material and read/write heads that move over the spinning platters. The data is stored in sectors on the platters, and the speed of data access is determined by the rotation speed of the disks. HDDs are widely used for mass storage due to their cost-effectiveness and high storage capacity. However, they generally exhibit slower read and write speeds and are more susceptible to physical shocks compared to SSDs.
