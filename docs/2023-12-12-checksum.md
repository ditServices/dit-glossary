# Checksum

A checksum is a value derived from a set of data, typically generated using a specific algorithm, to verify the integrity of the data during transmission or storage. It serves as a digital fingerprint, allowing users to detect errors, corruption, or tampering in the data. By comparing the checksum value at the source with the recalculated checksum at the destination, one can determine whether the data has been altered or if errors have occurred. Checksums are widely used in computer systems, network protocols, and data storage to ensure data reliability and security.

There are many checksum algorithms, however the most popular for the film and TV industry are MD5 and xxHash.
